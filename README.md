# Linguistic-Analysis-for-Depression-Detection-in-Hi-En-Mixed-Tweets
This is an ML project I and my team-mates (@Sentiment-analyser) made as part of minor project. We created a Sentiment Analyser Model for detecting depression from Tweets (Hi-En) using TF*IDF, Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and Grid Search. Th accuracy obtained on a dataset of nearly 700 tweets was 96.15%.
