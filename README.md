# Linguistic-Analysis-for-Depression-Detection-in-Hi-En-Mixed-Tweets
This is an ML project I and my team-mates (@Sentiment-analyser) made as part of minor project. We created a Sentiment Analyser Model for detecting depression from Tweets (Hi-En) using TF*IDF, Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and Grid Search. Th accuracy obtained on a dataset of nearly 700 tweets was 96.15%.
Our project was published by our professor, without acknowledging us: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359925742_Linguistic_Analysis_of_Hindi-English_Mixed_Tweets_for_Depression_Detection
